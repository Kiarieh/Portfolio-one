    <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p class="me"> I was born and raised in Nairobi. I began my formal education early at the St. Hannah's group of schools where I managed to complete my primary education before moving onto secondary school where I studied at the same school until completion in the year 2016 and gained a my first notable certificate.</p>
      <p class="out"> Out into the world I went, full of confidence but short of experience. I had wanted to be a medical student where I could go on and become a doctor, (didn't work out) but the dice had been rolled and they weren't in my favour. Journalism was next in line and I went for it. I am currently studying for my bachelors at Riara University.</p>
      <p class="moringa"> I decided to undertake the coding course at Moringa because I have always had a passion about coding and furthermore, I would love to give back to a community that has shown me nothing short of love and support in this journey to self discovery. Moreover the esteemed Moringa school is held in high stamdard by many, if not all, so I came to Moringa not just to learn how to code but to be the beast at it.</p>

    <h3>My Hobbies</h3>
      <p class="hobby"> I love nothing more than sleeping but that isn't a hobby, is it? My hobbies include playing football, reading and swimming.</p>
